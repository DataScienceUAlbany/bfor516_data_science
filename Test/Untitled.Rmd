This is my submission for homework 1.

## Question 1: Barplot

```{r}

dat_mpg <- mpg
ggplot(dat_mpg, aes(x = manufacturer, fill = manufacturer)) + 
  geom_bar()

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
