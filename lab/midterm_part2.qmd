Simulate mean detector runs for the following signal detection in noise problem:

\begin{eqnarray}
H_0: x(n) & = & w(n), n = 1, 2, \ldots, 10 \\
H_1: x(n) & = & -1.5 + w(n), n = 1, 2, \ldots, 10,
\end{eqnarray}

where $w(n) = {w(1), w(2), ..., w(10)}$ are realizations of a normal distribution with zero mean and variance 2.5.

Plot Receiver operating characteristic curve to assess the performance of this detector. Recommend the value of the detector threshold if probability of false alarm cannot be higher than 0.1.
